{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Critical Security Threat**: DDoS attacks can cause significant downtime, financial losses, and damage to your organization's reputation. Understanding attack types is the first step toward effective protection.
{{< /callout >}}

This comprehensive guide explores the various types of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that organizations face today. We'll examine attack characteristics, detection methods, and proven mitigation strategies for each category.

## Understanding DDoS Attacks

DDoS attacks aim to overwhelm target systems with malicious traffic, rendering them unavailable to legitimate users. These attacks can be categorized into three main types based on their approach and target.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Attack Evolution**: Modern DDoS attacks often combine multiple attack vectors, making them more challenging to detect and mitigate. A comprehensive defense strategy must address all attack types.
{{< /callout >}}

## Volume-Based Attacks

Volume-based attacks flood the target with massive amounts of traffic, overwhelming network bandwidth and infrastructure capacity.

### Common Volume Attack Types

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab title="UDP Flood" >}}
**Description**: Attackers send large volumes of UDP packets to random ports on the target system, forcing it to respond with ICMP "destination unreachable" messages.

**Characteristics**:
- High bandwidth consumption
- Targets network infrastructure
- Difficult to filter without legitimate traffic impact

**Mitigation**:
- Rate limiting on UDP traffic
- Traffic scrubbing services
- DDoS protection appliances
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab title="ICMP Flood" >}}
**Description**: Attackers overwhelm the target with ICMP echo request (ping) packets, consuming network resources and bandwidth.

**Characteristics**:
- Simple to execute
- High amplification potential
- Targets network layer

**Mitigation**:
- ICMP rate limiting
- Firewall rules blocking ICMP
- Network monitoring for unusual ICMP patterns
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab title="DNS Amplification" >}}
**Description**: Attackers exploit DNS servers to amplify attack traffic by sending small queries that generate large responses to the target.

**Characteristics**:
- High amplification ratio (up to 70:1)
- Uses legitimate DNS infrastructure
- Difficult to trace back to source

**Mitigation**:
- DNS response rate limiting
- Anycast DNS deployment
- Source IP validation
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Volume Attack Detection

```bash
# Monitor network bandwidth utilization
netstat -i

# Check for unusual traffic patterns
tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap

# Analyze traffic flows
iftop -i eth0

# Monitor system resources
top -p $(pgrep -d',' -f "network|http")
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Detection Challenge**: Volume attacks can be difficult to distinguish from legitimate traffic spikes. Implement baseline monitoring to establish normal traffic patterns.
{{< /callout >}}

## Protocol Attacks

Protocol attacks exploit weaknesses in network protocols and consume server resources rather than bandwidth.

### Common Protocol Attack Types

{{< cards >}}
{{< card title="SYN Flood" icon="exclamation" content="Overwhelms servers with TCP SYN packets, leaving connections in half-open state and exhausting connection tables." >}}

{{< card title="ACK Flood" icon="exclamation" content="Sends large volumes of ACK packets to consume processing resources and disrupt legitimate connections." >}}

{{< card title="Fragmentation Attacks" icon="exclamation" content="Exploits IP fragmentation to bypass security measures and overwhelm reassembly buffers." >}}
{{< /cards >}}

### SYN Flood Attack Details

SYN flood attacks are particularly dangerous because they target the TCP handshake process:

```bash
# Example of SYN flood detection
# Monitor SYN packets per second
tcpdump -i eth0 'tcp[tcpflags] & tcp-syn != 0' | wc -l

# Check for incomplete connections
netstat -an | grep SYN_RECV | wc -l

# Monitor connection table usage
cat /proc/net/sockstat
```

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- SYN cookies implementation
- Connection rate limiting
- TCP timeout optimization
- Load balancer protection

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Protocol Protection**: Implement proper TCP/IP stack hardening and use SYN cookies to prevent SYN flood attacks from consuming server resources.
{{< /callout >}}

## Application Layer Attacks

Application layer attacks target specific applications and services, making them harder to detect and mitigate.

### HTTP-Based Attacks

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab title="HTTP Flood" >}}
**Description**: Overwhelms web servers with legitimate-looking HTTP requests, consuming application resources.

**Types**:
- GET/POST floods
- Cache-busting attacks
- Session exhaustion

**Detection**:
- Monitor request rates per IP
- Analyze user agent patterns
- Track session creation rates
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab title="Slowloris" >}}
**Description**: Maintains many connections to the target server, sending partial HTTP requests to keep connections alive.

**Characteristics**:
- Low bandwidth usage
- Difficult to detect
- Targets connection limits

**Mitigation**:
- Connection timeout settings
- Request rate limiting
- Load balancer protection
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab title="SSL/TLS Attacks" >}}
**Description**: Exploits SSL/TLS handshake process to consume server CPU resources through cryptographic operations.

**Types**:
- SSL renegotiation attacks
- TLS handshake floods
- Certificate validation attacks

**Mitigation**:
- SSL offloading
- Connection rate limiting
- Hardware acceleration
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Application Attack Detection

```bash
# Monitor HTTP request rates
tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# Check for slow connections
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c

# Monitor SSL handshake performance
openssl s_time -connect target:443 -new -time 10
```

## Advanced Attack Vectors

Modern DDoS attacks often combine multiple techniques for maximum impact.
